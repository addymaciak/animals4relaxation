	<img src="images/SPEEDY.jpg" style="width:600px;height:700px;" class="center" alt="Sun 
	seeps in and casts shadows of a window frame on a red rug around a cat. The calico cat 
	lounges on the red rug in the sun. Laying slightly on its back, the cat exposes its 
	fluffy white stomach. In a sleepy snooze the cat stretches three of its legs out. The 
	cat soaks up the midday sun while catching a cat nap.">
	
	<img src="images/3kitties.jpg" style="width:600px;height:700px;" class="center" alt="
	Three pudgy cats are held in the arms of a person. The person supports the cats under 
	their arms and let’s their bodies dangle. Each cat has a different silly expression. 
	The three cats look identical in appearance. They have light tan fuzzy fur, short ears, 
	and big paws.">

	scruffy grey dog pokes its head out from a hammock. The hammock is attached to a tree 
	and is facing a large body of calm blue water and a sky full of soft clouds. The dog’s 
	face is illuminated by the sun with a calm expression. Its eyes are covered by shaggy 
	grey and white fur." >
	
	<img src="images/COW.jpg" style="width:600px;height:700px;" class="center" alt="A 
	sweet baby cow stands in front of trees, highlighted by the sun. The calf raises it’s
	chin towards the sky as it soaks up the rays. It’s baby pink nose and dark eyes are 
	illuminated. Its face has an expression of peace and contentment. Its fuzzy fur shines 
	in the sun and displays a beautiful pattern of black splotches on white.">
 
	<img src="images/twocats.jpg" style="width:600px;height:700px;" class="center" alt="
	Two cats lounging in the sun pop against a deep blue sky. The cat’s heads poke up from
	the bottom of the photo. The cats are wearing matching red collars with darling silver
	bells. The cat on the left is white with orange ears. The cat on the right is an 
	orange tabby cat with a white chin." >
